# Safely.js

```javascript
safely(keepGoingIfThisFunctionFails)
```

Exceptions are rescued and automatically reported to your favorite reporting service.

In development and test environments, exceptions are raised so you can fix them.

## Reporting

Reports exceptions to [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) out of the box.

Customize reporting with:

```javascript
Safely.reportExceptionMethod = function (e) {
  // report to your favorite service
};
```

## Installation

Download [safely.js](safely.js), include it, and set the environment

```html
<script src="path/to/safely.js"></script>
<script>
  Safely.env = "production";
</script>
```
